This is the ZZT Crashopedia, a collection of ways to crash ZZT. Beyond being
just fun and interesting, it also serves as test cases for ZZT clones. I want
to eventually include every bug that my fuzz testing of ZZT has found, so that
clones and reimplementations can be made much more robust.

As the Crashopedia repo contains both a set of ZZT worlds and source code, it
is dual licensed. The worlds themselves are CC-BY-SA, while the helper source
is GPL 3 licensed.

(I haven't included the source code yet.)
