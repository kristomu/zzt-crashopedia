This directory contains the Super Lock tool from Software Visions' ZZT Tools
toolkit. The toolkit can be found at https://museumofzzt.com/file/view/zzttool/.
The Super Lock tool is in the public domain.

It also contains the file SUPERLCK.ZZT, which is a Super Locked ZZT file whose
last board can be used to test if a ZZT implementation or editor is able to
recover Super Locked last boards. It's possible to do so because all the board
data remains; the file size count has just been modified.

The file SUPERLCK.ZZT.orig is the uncorrupted pre-Super Lock file.
